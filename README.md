# Barcodes
More than once I had to generate EAN13 or EAN128 barcodes, while I didn't have the necessary funds to pay for the fonts and/or software to do that for me. 
I'm still a student, and as I guess you can understand, more than $99 for a simple font is something a bit out of my reach.
All the codes generated here can be used with the following free fonts:

https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/download/732961 by "barcode" for EAN13

https://www.dafont.com/es/code-128.font by "Grand Zebu" for EAN128

For now, the only encoding available for 128 is CodeA, though I will keep adding the other ones, as well as Code39 in the short foreseeable future.

The methods are relatively simple and resumed in a short comment.
Should you need more documentation, I will be updating this as soon as I can.

If this was useful to you and you feel like dropping a dime for a student in need, I shall leave my Paypal Page over here https://paypal.me/AManu93

Please feel free to raise any issues and I shall take a look asap.
